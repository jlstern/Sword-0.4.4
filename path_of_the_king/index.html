		<h2>How to play</h2>
		<p>You have been trapped in a labyrinth by your enemies. It will take everything you have to escape and reclaim your throne!</p>
		<p>Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to navigate the labyrinth. While exploring the labyrinth, you will be periodically attacked by monsters. Use your mouse to select which ability to use and then click on an enemy to target them. As you progress through battles you will have a chance to level up. Every level will improve your stats and grant you new abilities. Choose wisely. </p>
		<p>The game ends when you reach the end of the maze and manage to recclaim your throne. Beware, if you fall in combat, you will have to start over at the beginning.</p>
